Algorithm for Insertion Sort
1: Iterate from arr[1] to arr[n] over the array.
2: Compare the current element (key) to its predecessor.
3: If the key element is smaller than its predecessor, compare it to the elements before. Move the greater elements one position up to make space for the swapped element.

arr=list(map(int,input().strip().split()))
n=int(input())
for i in range(1,n):
    key=arr[i]      
    j=i-1
    while j>=0 and key<arr[j]:
        arr[j+1]=arr[j]  
        j-=1
    arr[j+1]=key
print(arr)
